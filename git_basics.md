## Git Basics

### git init
Git init creates a new, empty Git repository in the current folder. It sets up all the internal Git files so that Git can start tracking changes to your project.

### git add
Git add stages changes (new or modified files) so they are ready to be committed. It tells Git which files you want to include in the next snapshot of your project.

### git commit
Git commit takes all staged changes and saves them as a new snapshot in the repository history. Each commit has a message that explains what changed and allows you to go back to that state later.

### git push
Git push sends your local commits to a remote repository like GitHub. It updates the remote branch so your latest work is backed up and can be shared with others.
